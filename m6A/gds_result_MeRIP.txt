2. The RNA N6-methyladenosine regulates chromatin remodeling and transcription [HEC-1-A_seq_RNA_MeRIP]
(Submitter supplied) The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to regulate stability and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in various biological processes. Here, we show that the knockout of the m6A writer Mettl3 or a nuclear reader Ythdc1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) induces chromatin openness and transcription activation in an m6A-dependent manner. We identified extensive m6A modifications on caRNAs (chromosome-associated RNAs, including promoter-associated RNAs, enhancer RNAs and repeats) that are installed by METTL3. more...

3. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) profiling of ovarian cancer tissues
(Submitter supplied) We developed RADAR , a method for detecting differential methylated loci in MeRIP-seq data. RADAR uses a flexible model to accommodate increased noise due to RNA immunoprecipitation and are compatible with complex study design. RADAR enabled accurate identification of altered methylation sites in patient  samples where covariates need to be accounted for. We use the m6A-profiling of ovarian cancer data as an example data set to benchmart the performance of RADAR and a few alternative methods.

Previous reports have found m6A on both cellular and viral transcripts and defined its role in regulating numerous biological processes, including viral infection.

Indeed, we observed a reduction of modification peaks at the 5’-end but not the 3’-UTR regions of mRNA upon PCIF1 KD.

34. Comprehensive Analysis of mRNA Methylation Reveals Enrichment in 3' UTRs and Near Stop Codons
(Submitter supplied) Here, we use a novel technique for locating regions of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) throughout the transcriptome and present a profile of m6A sites in the mouse brain. Our use of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-seq (MeRIP-Seq) identifies thousands of RNAs which contain m6A sites. In addition, we find that regions of m6A formation are particularly enriched near stop codons, which might provide clues into the potential funciton of this highly prevalent RNA modificaiton.
