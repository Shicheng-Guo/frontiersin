Here we show that transcriptomic m6A modification is dynamic and the m6A reader protein YTHDF2 promotes mRNA decay during the cell cycle. Depletion of YTHDF2 leads to the delay of mitotic entry due to overaccumulation of WEE1, a negative regulator of CDK1. We demonstrate that WEE1 transcripts contain m6A modification, which promotes their decay through the m6A reader YTHDF2. more...

33. Viral N6-methyladenosine upregulates replication and pathogenesis of human respiratory syncytial virus
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of mRNAs in most eukaryotes. Likewise, viral RNAs may acquire m6A methylation during replication within these cells. Here we show that RNAs of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a medically important non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA virus, are modified by m6A within discreet regions and that these modifications enhance viral replication and pathogenesis. more...

34. Regulation of pre-mRNA splicing by m6A through the low-complexity protein hnRNPG and co-transcriptional pausing
(Submitter supplied) Co-transcriptional processing of nascent transcripts is coupled with transcription through the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The mRNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) occurs co-transcriptionally and impacts pre-mRNA processing. How alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is co-transcriptionally regulated in an m6A-dependent manner is not well understood. Furthermore, splicing regulation through RNAPII pausing has been frequently suggested but the underlying control mechanism remains unclear. more...

(Submitter supplied) Dynamic mRNA modification in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) adds considerable richness and sophistication to gene regulation. The m6A mark is asymmetrically distributed along mature mRNAs, with a strong preference around the stop codon and 3’UTR. Nevertheless, approximately 35% of m6A residues are located within the coding region (CDS). It has been suggested that methylation in CDS slows down translation elongation by interfering the decoding process. more...

We used the uninfected replicates, among which we would expect little biological variation in methylation, as negative controls to validate statistical methods for the detection of m6A changes in MeRIP-seq data. more...

We envisioned that the cap-specific PCIF1 should selectively alter the m6Am modification at the 5-terminal region of transcripts. Indeed, we observed a reduction of modification peaks at the 5’-end but not the 3’-UTR regions of mRNA upon PCIF1 KD.

However, the rapid acquisition of resistance limits TKI effectiveness. Here we establish TKI-resistant cells that propagate in the absence of RTK signaling. Relative to sensitive cells, TKI-resistant cells display decreased N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a ubiquitous and reversible modification on RNA, but upregulated fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO), an m6A demethylase. more...

In addition to the internal m6A, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM) responsible for N6-methylation of m6Am. more...

97. The role of m6A/m-RNA methylation in stress response regulation
(Submitter supplied) N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) and N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) are abundant mRNA modifications that regulate transcript processing and translation. The role of both, here termed m6A/m, in the stress response in the adult brain in vivo are currently unknown. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the stress-epitranscriptome using m6A/m-Seq, global and gene-specific m6A/m measurements. We show that stress exposure and glucocorticoids region- and time-specifically alter m6A/m and its regulatory network. more...

Precise transcriptome-wide assignment of m6A sites is of utmost importance. However, m6A does not interfere with Watson-Crick base pairing making polymerase-based detection challenging. We developed a chemical biology approach for the precise mapping of methyltransferase (MTase) target sites based on the introduction of a bioorthogonal propargyl group in vitro and in cells. more...

While many m6A modifications are installed by the METTL3-METTL14 complex, others appear to be introduced independently, implying that additional human m6A methyltransferases remain to be identified. Using crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), we reveal that the putative human m6A “writer” protein METTL16 binds to the U6 snRNA and other ncRNAs as well as numerous lncRNAs and pre-mRNAs. more...

128. The U6 snRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL16 regulates SAM synthetase intron retention
(Submitter supplied) Maintenance of the intracellular levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is essential for a wide variety of biological processes. We demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 regulates expression of MAT2A, which encodes the only SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Upon SAM depletion by methionine starvation, cells induce MAT2A expression by enhanced splicing of a retained intron. more...

One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5′ end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. more...

159. High-resolution mapping reveals a conserved, widespread, dynamic meiotically regulated mRNA methylation program [Hs]
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common modification of mRNA, with potential roles in fine-tuning the RNA life cycle, but little is known about the pathways regulating this process and its physiological role. Here, we used mass-spectrometry to identify a dense network of proteins physically interacting with METTL3, a core component of the methyltransferase complex, and show that two of them, WTAP and KIAA1429, are required for methylation. more...

161. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

162. Identification and Characterization of the Mammalian Nuclear RNA N6-Adenosine Methyltransferase Core Complex
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification found in mammalian messenger and non-coding RNAs. The discoveries of functionally significant demethylases that reverse this methylation as well as the recently revealed m6A distributions in mammalian transcriptomes strongly indicate regulatory functions of this modification. Here we report the identification and characterization of the mammalian nuclear RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase core (RNMTC) complex. more...

(Submitter supplied) Contemporary treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires the assignment of patients to specific risk groups. To explore whether expression profiling of leukemic blasts could accurately distinguish between the known risk groups of AML, we analyzed 130 pediatric and 20 adult AML diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using the Affymetrix U133A microarray.  Class discriminating genes were identified for each of the major prognostic subtypes of pediatric AML, including t(15;17)[PML-RARalpha], t(8;21)[AML1-ETO], inv(16) [CBFbeta-MYH11], MLL chimeric fusion genes, and cases classified as FAB-M7. more...

167. Stochastic genome - nuclear lamina contacts are linked to histone H3K9 dimethylation (RNA-seq data)
(Submitter supplied) The nuclear lamina (NL) interacts with hundreds of large genomic regions termed lamina-associated domains (LADs). The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a novel 'molecular contact memory' approach. In each interphase nucleus, only ~30% of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we use a novel technique for locating regions of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) throughout the transcriptome and present a profile of m6A sites in the mouse brain. Our use of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-seq (MeRIP-Seq) identifies thousands of RNAs which contain m6A sites. In addition, we find that regions of m6A formation are particularly enriched near stop codons, which might provide clues into the potential funciton of this highly prevalent RNA modificaiton.
